# Lettuce Entertain You - Jr. Web Developer Coding Challenge

This repository contains my submission for the Lettuce Entertain You Jr. Web Developer take-home coding challenge.

The goal of this project was to recreate a section of the Mon Ami Gabi website mockup using React/Next.js, implement specific functionalities (like the reservation form and events section with data fetching and filtering), and meet various technical requirements including responsiveness and accessibility standards.

**Live Demo:**

**Technologies Used:**

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and API routes.
- **TypeScript:** Typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS v4:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **shadcn/ui:** UI component library built on Tailwind CSS (used for the Sheet component).
- **react-icons** Icon component library for hamburger menu icon to trigger sheet.

**Features Implemented:**

- Responsive recreation of the Mon Ami Gabi website section based on the provided mockup.ðŸš§
- Implementation of a functional reservation form (logs data to console).ðŸš§
- Dynamic "Upcoming Events" section: ðŸš§
  - Fetches data from the provided JSON endpoint.
  - Filters out past events.
  - Displays events without dates at the bottom.
  - Includes city filtering functionality.
- Responsive navigation handling for desktop and mobile using Tailwind and shadcn/ui Sheet. ðŸš§
- Focus on clean code, clear naming conventions, and semantic HTML. ðŸš§
- Effort to meet ADA/WCAG accessibility standards (audited with Lighthouse). ðŸš§

**Notes on Implementation & Design Choices:**

- For the mobile navigation, I opted to use the shadcn/ui Sheet component to provide a smooth slide-in experience while leveraging its built-in accessibility features.
- I focused on using Tailwind's utility-first approach to style the components, configuring the LEYE color palette and fonts in the theme.
